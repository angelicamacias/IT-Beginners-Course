What ara JS Freameworks and why they are useful? 
They build these useful JS frameworks using vanilla JS itself 


- Easier to manage your code 
- Abstrac away the complexity for working with HTML 
- You can use these programs to write your applications more easily and faster 

React.js:
    - Doesn't enforce a specific projects structure
    - Works very efficientely with the DOM

    - More full-fledge framework

Vue.js:
    - Ligthweight and flexible 



Open source

- Open source is very common in the tech world
- In almost all cases, open source software is free
- Software, where the source code is publicy accessible
- People can modify and share and contribute to the source code 


Libraries 

- Collection of code targeted for specific common problems 
- Open source and free to use 

Libraries and frameworks 

- Frameworks and libraries are an essential part of software development 

Where to access those iberies or frameworks? 


Repository 

Is a place, an actual storage location where you store those programs. 

- A storafe location for software packages
- Developers can publish their programs to this repository 
- Others can download them from the repo and use it in their app 

-- Repository packages

Programs usually consist of hundreds of files

All files, scripts etc ehtat make up the program get packaged into 1 single file or package 

1) Download form a package repository 
2) Use the framework / library in our program 

Each programming language has its own package type and package repository 

## Npm 

npm: stands for Nde Package Manager 
npm: is a package manager 
manages software packages 
Can be used to install (download), upgrade, configure packages 
nps registry is a repository form JavaScript packages

-Registry: The service that makes all packages available (collection of repositories)

-Reository: The actual storage


--- A good libary has good documentation, like how to use the libray or what functions are available 


Any JS package, any software has a version, helps users and software providers to keep track of the changes and modifications.

For each new relese/new version the maintainer of the software provide release notes
 - Release
 Basically when you release a new version of 
 - Release notes
    -List of what has changed
    - Explain new features added
    - Issues resolved which improvements 

## Version scheme

In software development a common version format has been established

The version has threee part version number

```
3.2.40
```
the name of this version scheme is semantic versioing and widely adopted 

3: Mejor version 
- Big changes (features, bugfixes)
- Incomparible changes that affect apps that use older versions 

2: Minor version
- Add new functions 
- Add new bugfixes 
Minor changes 
- Changes are backwards compatible 

40: Patch version 
- Usually only for bug fixes 
- Which are backwards compatible 


--- A software bug is an error or flaw in the software that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result

 We can change *latest* for the version: 13.7.0

 ## Tags

 Allow you to identify specific release versions 

## Summary

 - Include library in our application
