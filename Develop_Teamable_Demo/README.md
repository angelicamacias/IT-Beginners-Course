# Create UI in simple JS - initial code

### <span>

To wrap text 
Much link the <p> or <div> element
Difference is that these are block-level elements, whereas span is an inline element. 

Block-Level = takes up full width
Line = Only takes up as much width as necessary 




1) Get value of input field object
2) Set text of the "name" element


display: none hides and shows elements without deleting and recreating them!
